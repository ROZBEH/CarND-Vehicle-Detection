# Vehicle Detection
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)



Overview
---

In this project, our goal is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video. Before testing the pipeline on a video, we first try to make sure our vehicle detection classifier works on images file. After that, we get each frame of the video and pass it to the pipeline. Pipline will return the output video along with the bounding boxes around each vehicle.

*The pipeline along with the corresponding python codes will be described here.*

*Note: I have not included the training data in my submission, because my github repository has limited space.*
